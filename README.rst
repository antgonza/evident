E-vident: elucidating sampling effort for microbial analysis studies
====================================================================

|Build Status| |Coverage Status|

A critical consideration in any clinical study is power analysis, yet it has
been difficult to perform such analyses for microbiome studies because the effect
sizes of different disorders are unknown. Fortunately, several larger cohort studies,
including but not limited to the Human Microbiome Project, now allow us to identify
effect sizes for differences among ages and populations, and differences associated
with obesity, IBD, and other disorders.

The original Evident demo was a web-based software tool that can be found `here <https://github.com/biocore/Evident-initial-demo`__.
